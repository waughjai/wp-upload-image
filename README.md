WP Upload Image
=========================

Class for autogenerating HTML for WordPress media image with just the ID.

Just pass in ID & WordPress will automatically generate HTMLImage object based on ID in media. If no item with the given ID is in media database, then it just creates an empty HTMLImage object.

Error handling works just as it does for HTMLImage. Look up its documentation for moâ€™ information.
